# PELICAN Network for Particle Physics

    Permutation Equivariant, Lorentz Invariant/Covariant Aggregator Network for applications in Particle Physics.
    At the moment it includes two main variants: a classifier (for e.g. top-tagging) and a 4-momentum regression network.

# PELICAN: Flexible Dataset Loading Fork

This repository is a fork of the original PELICAN code by Abogatskiy. It incorporates additional functionality to enhance dataset loading flexibility for distributed training on multi-GPU systems.

## Overview

In many large-scale training scenarios, loading entire datasets into RAM can quickly exhaust available system memoryâ€”especially when running multiple processes in parallel. This fork introduces a new command-line argument, `--ram_split`, which allows you to specify which dataset splits should be loaded into memory. For example, you can choose to load only the test and validation splits into RAM (using `--ram_split=test,valid`) while streaming the training data directly from disk. This flexibility can help optimize memory usage and performance.

## Key Features

### Configurable Dataset RAM Loading

Use the `--ram_split` argument to control which dataset splits are loaded entirely into memory. Options include:
- `"all"`: Load all splits into RAM
- `"none"`: Do not load any split into RAM
- A comma-separated list (e.g., `train,test`, `test,valid`): Load only the specified splits into RAM

### Distributed Training Support

Optimized for distributed training environments on nodes with multiple GPUs. Each process only loads the necessary data, helping to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

### Tribute to the Original PELICAN Code

This project is based on and inspired by the excellent work of Abogatskiy.
